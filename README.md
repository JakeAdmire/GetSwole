# GetSwole
### A mobile application for scheduling user-specific workout routines.

## Overview

### GetSwole was the capstone project for Module 4 students at Turing School of Software and Design.  Students from both the Frontend and Backend programs are put in groups of 4 and given 13 days to create a full-stack application.  This project gave us further insight into how teams communicate and collaborate so that the development process flows smoothly.  As well, our group chose to work in React Native, a framework that was new to the entire team.
