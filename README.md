GetSwole is a convenient way of scheduling your fitness life, in the form of a native app. During this project I led a group of 3 other engineers through the challenges that came with learning a new framework on the go. This was during the 4th quarter of the Turing School of Software & Design

## What were my goals for this project?

Throughout this project I maintained the usual goals of pushing my team to perform in an Agile environment by utilizing continuous integration testing, daily standups/retros, code review, and following other SCRUM methodologies.

Additionally, this was the first time I'd worked with a back-end software developer.

#### Technical Goals:
- Using multiple environments (i.e. development, testing, CI, and production)
- Building a functional native application in a new framework

## Screenshots & Explanation:

Here you can see David enter his name into the prompt and submit. In the header of the next page he's welcomed by name and given a display of his currently scheduled routines.

When David presses the 'Add New Routine' button he's transferred to a page that allows him to create a custom routine and fill it with a database of hundreds of available exercises. After titling the routine he's taken back to the home page where his newly created routine has been placed within the schedule.

## Future Development Notes
With this project I'd like to rebuild it from scratch rather than polish what's there. It'd allow me to take a deeper dive into the React Native framework and improve my proficiency with UI design.

In the event that I do rebuild GetSwole, here are some updates I'd like to include:
- A more intuitive exercise search engine with filtering options such as available equipment, targeted muscle, etc.
- A screen that allows users to complete their scheduled workouts and update the sets, reps, weight, and time spent on each one.
- More authentication than just a name. Most likely OAuth.
